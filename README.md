# AB-TESTING
## Statistical Analysis.

### Problem Statement

An online learning university offers free online courses worldwide. Every student that signs up for the course must take an admission quiz and obtain a certain percentage in order to join the course. Some students only sign-up and never take an admission quiz which means they do not join the course.

The University would like to know if sending a reminder email to those applicants who haven't taken the quiz will have a positive impact on quiz completion rate.

In other words, this project is testing sending an email will have an positive impact on quiz completion rate.(**Test of Independence**)

### project objectives:

Nothing much project was done in class but data was not made available publicly.


### Data Source

Due to the scarcity of data. I decided to generate my own synthetic data though it's not close to good but it serves the purpose. 

I generated this data and uploaded it to a MOngoDB database in the cloud. w

In this project I used an ancient way of generating synthetic data. 
### Data Types

The data is both categorical and numerical

Areas of Improvement:
Learn to generate data that is close to reality. For example, "Education" feature is far from reality. 
NB! I am not doing a lot of analysis because the data isn't real and the distrinutions are bad.
