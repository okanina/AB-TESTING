## Statistical Analysis.

### Problem Statement

An online learning university offers free online courses worldwide. Every student that signs up for the course must take an admission quiz and obtain a certain percentage in order to join the course. Some students only signs up and never takes an admission quize which mean they do not join the course.

The University would like to know if sending a reminder email to those applicants who haven't taken the quiz will have a positive impact on quize completion rate.

### Data Source

Data is very synthetic. Please go easy on me I haven't done any CTGAN just read a bit.

In this project I used an ancient way of generating synthetic data. Most of the distributions are very far from reality they're work in progress.

### Data Types

The data is both categorical and numerical
